# Authentication vs Authorization (CompTIA Lesson 1)

## Authentication = Who you are
Authentication verifies identity.
Examples:
- Logging in with a password
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint)

## Authorization = What you can do
Authorization controls access after identity is verified.
Examples:
- Admin can read/write/delete
- Viewer can read only
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

## Real-world example
- Authentication: You log into a bank app.
- Authorization: The app decides if you can transfer money, view statements, or manage users.

## Why it matters in security
- Authentication prevents impersonation.
- Authorization prevents unauthorized actions and data exposure.
